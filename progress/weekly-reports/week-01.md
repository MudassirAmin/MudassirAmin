# About the week :

this week was bullshit, didn't do much this week and struggled bad with distractions,
I was cutting down on media with distracting imagery (basically half naked women) and it so damn hard to just avoid that on youtube,
damn western ladies with their damn cocktail dresses and skin tight clothes, have got no dignity left and that psychology affects the males seeing that.

bad stuff, and nowadays cant even avoid that stuff, being almost naked is mainstream now.
gonna quit youtube for the next week, not gonna watch any and all things that might have that sort of imagery.

also learnt something useful about making it easy and available to set daily minimum goals and to put it somewhere open and visible.
gonna do that for next week.
