today was Friday 25/10/2025 
I am making this weekly review logging system. and this week has been half decent, got the motivation to set up this weekly review system on 22/10/2025.
so, from now I will try to log on everything on this digital diary of sorts.

here is the template for reading, 

âœ… What I coded today:
âœ… What I learned:
âœ… Applications sent:
âœ… Tomorrow's priority:

### **Weekly Accountability**

**Every Friday - The Weekly Review**:

1. **Did I hit my goals?** (Yes/No/Partial)
2. **What worked well this week?**
3. **What blocked me?**
4. **Next week's ONE big goal?**
5. **Did I post about my learning?** 

**Minimum Weekly Success Criteria**:
- Coded 5+ days âœ“
- Made progress on current project âœ“
- Learned something new âœ“
- (After Month 4) Sent applications âœ“

**If you hit 3/4 = Good week**
**If you hit 4/4 = Great week**
**If you hit 2/4 = Warning - need course correction**

### **Recovery Protocols**

#### **SCENARIO 1: Missed 3-4 Days**
**Don't**: Feel guilty, restart from scratch, binge to catch up
**Do**: 
1. Review last thing you learned (30 min)
2. Do a simple coding warm-up (1 hour)
3. Back to 50% intensity for 2 days
4. Resume normal schedule

#### **SCENARIO 2: Feeling Overwhelmed**
**Symptoms**: Too many tabs open, paralyzed, not starting anything
**Fix**:
1. Close everything
2. Pick ONE tutorial/project
3. Set timer for 25 minutes
4. Just start, even badly
5. After 25 min, you'll have momentum

#### **SCENARIO 3: Burned Out**
**Symptoms**: Resentment, avoiding coding, watching tutorials passively
**Fix**:
1. Take 2-3 days completely off
2. Do something fun (games, friends, hobbies)
3. Return with a "fun" project (game, silly app)
4. Lower intensity for a week
5. Remember: rest is productive

#### **SCENARIO 4: Job Rejections Piling Up**
**Emotional hit is real**
**Fix**:
1. This is NORMAL - even great devs get 100+ rejections
2. Review: Is resume good? Are projects live? Is LinkedIn optimized?
3. Get 2-3 people to review your applications
4. Expand search criteria temporarily
5. Build something impressive this week (therapy + portfolio)
6. Remember: You only need ONE yes

### **Monthly Reset**

**If a month goes badly**:

1. **Don't panic** - you have 12 months, one bad month won't kill it
2. **Diagnose honestly**: 
   - Was goal too ambitious?
   - Was I distracted by something?
   - Did I lack clarity?
   - Was I avoiding something?
3. **Adjust next month by 20%**, not 50%
4. **Get an accountability buddy** (find one online)
5. **Change the environment** (new coffee shop, library, schedule)
